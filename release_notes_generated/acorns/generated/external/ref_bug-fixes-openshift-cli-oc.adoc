* Previously, on macOS arm64 architecture, the `oc` binary needed to be signed manually. As a result, the `oc` binary did not work as expected. This update implements a self-signing binary for `oc` mimicking. As a result, the `oc` binary on macOS arm64 architectures works properly.

* Previously, `must-gather` was trying to collect resources that were not present on the server. Consequently, `must-gather` would print error messages. Now, before collecting resources, `must-gather` checks whether the resource exists. As a result, `must-gather` no longer prints an error when it fails to collect non-existing resources on the server.
