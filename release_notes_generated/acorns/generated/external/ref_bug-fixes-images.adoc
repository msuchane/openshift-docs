* Previously, the image trigger controller did not have permissions to change objects. Consequently, image trigger annotations did not work on some resources. This update creates cluster role binding that provides the controller the required permissions to update objects according to annotations.

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not have a `progressing` condition for the `node-ca` daemon set and used `generation` from an incorrect object. Consequently, the `node-ca` daemon set could be marked as `degraded` while the Operator was still running. This update adds the `progressing` condition, which indicates that the installation is not complete. As a result, the Image Registry Operator successfully installs the `node-ca` daemon set and the installer waits until it is fully deployed.
