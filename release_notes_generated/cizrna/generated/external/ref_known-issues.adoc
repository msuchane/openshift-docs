Proposed doc text:

* When scaling up an Alibaba Cloud cluster with {op-system-base} compute nodes, the new nodes show as `Ready`, but the Ingress pods do not transition to `Running` on these nodes. As a result, the scale-up operation does not succeed. As a workaround, you can perform a scale-up operation with {op-system} compute nodes.
